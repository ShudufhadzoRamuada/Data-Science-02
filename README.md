# Titanic Survival Prediction Analysis
This project analyzes Titanic passenger data to explore the survival rates based on different features such as gender, age, and class. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships in the data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations.

## Key Insights:
### Gender: 
Females had a survival rate of over 80%, while males had a survival rate below 40%.
### Class: 
Passengers in second class had the highest survival rate. First- and third-class passengers had similar, lower survival rates.
### Age: 
Children had the highest survival rate, followed by middle-aged passengers, then teens, adults, and seniors.

## Steps Taken:
### Data Cleaning: 
Merged two datasets using an outer join and removed rows with missing values to ensure a clean dataset.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conducted various visualizations to explore survival rates by gender, class, and age group.
### Visualization: U
sed Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting survival rates across different categories.

## Tools & Libraries:
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation and cleaning
Matplotlib – Data visualization
Seaborn – Statistical data visualization

## Installation:
### Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-analysis.git
### Install the required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Future Work:
Experiment with more advanced predictive models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest.
Investigate other features like fare, SibSp, and Parch to improve analysis.
